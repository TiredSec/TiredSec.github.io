<p>One day a couple years ago i had revcieved an email claiming "<strong>i hAd bEeN cHoSeN</strong>", it was immediately clear that this was some sort of scam as:<br>
A) i have never been chosen for anything<br>
B) theres no Dicks sporting goods where i live.</p>
<p> So i decided to dig a little deeper into it, but before that i wanted to find out how emails work in the first place</p>
